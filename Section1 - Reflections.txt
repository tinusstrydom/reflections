How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?

    Made it easier to spot and faster 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a
file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can see what was done and tested ,can see direction
    project was taken in , can help with re factoring code
    or go back and go in another direction

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually
choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    To many saves that some migh be not be logical.
    Manually better logical to save when
    change is big enough and clear.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is code oriented and the others are none code 
    oriented.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view
the history of files?

    log help with seeing the id and the message of the
    commits and then can check the differences between
    them with using the git diff id id to check     

How might using version control make you more confident to
make changes that could break something?

    Will help alot with bug fixes and you can revert quite
    easily to previous versions can also split development
    anywhere along the road , with branches

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want
to try using Git for?

    version control ,with projects
